static vs instance variable in java

ChatGPT said:
Awesome! Letâ€™s break down the difference between static and instance variables in Java â€” super important for understanding how Java classes work.

ðŸ”¹ Instance Variables
Belong to objects (instances of a class).

Every object gets its own copy of the variable.

Declared without the static keyword.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class Dog {
    String name;  // instance variable
}
If you create two dogs:

java
Copy
Edit
Dog dog1 = new Dog();
dog1.name = "Buddy";

Dog dog2 = new Dog();
dog2.name = "Charlie";
Each Dog object has its own separate name.

ðŸ”¹ Static Variables
Belong to the class, not to any specific object.

Shared among all instances of the class.

Declared with the static keyword.

Example:
java
Copy
Edit
public class Dog {
    static String species = "Canine"; // static variable
}
You can access it like this:

java
Copy
Edit
System.out.println(Dog.species);  // Canine
Or through objects (but not recommended):

java
Copy
Edit
Dog d = new Dog();
System.out.println(d.species);    // Canine
Even if you change it using one object, it affects all:

java
Copy
Edit
Dog dog1 = new Dog();
Dog dog2 = new Dog();

dog1.species = "Wolf";  // changes for ALL dogs

System.out.println(dog2.species);  // Wolf
ðŸ”¸ Quick Comparison Table:

Feature	Instance Variable	Static Variable
Belongs to	An object	The class itself
Memory allocation	Per object	Only once per class
Accessed via	Object reference	Class name (or object, not preferred)
Affected by	Individual object changes	Changes reflect across all instances
Use case	Object-specific data	Shared data across all instances
âœ… When to Use Which?
Use instance variables when each object should have its own state.

Use static variables when the value should be common across all objects, like constants or shared counters.
